    <h1>My Favorite DJs</h1>

    <p>I listen to a lot of house and electronic music. These are a few of my favorite DJs</p>

    <h2>Top 3 Picks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>John Summit</strong> Has some more melodic songs. I like listening to this when I'm relaxing more.</li>
      <li><strong>Dom Dolla</strong> His shows are super energetic and has more of a party vibe.</li>
      <li><strong>Odd Mob</strong> He has a lot of great remixes!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why I Like Them</h2>
    <p>Their songs always put me in a good mood. I like how they each have their own sound but still make music that work when going out or just hanging out.</p>
